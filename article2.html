    <div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    
    <p>Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code is a section of the Indian Penal Code introduced in 1864 during the British rule of India. Modelled on the Buggery Act of 1533, it is used to criminalize sexual activities "against the order of nature". On 6 September 2018, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the application of Section 377 to consensual homosexual sex</p>

  <div class="column">
    
    <p>between adults was unconstitutional, "irrational, indefensible and manifestly arbitrary", but that Section 377 remains in force relating to sex with minors, non-consensual sexual acts, and bestiality.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    
    <p>Portions of the section were first struck down as unconstitutional with respect to gay sex by the Delhi High Court in July 2009. That judgement was overturned by the Supreme Court of India (SC) on 11 December 2013 in Suresh Kumar Koushal vs. Naz Foundation. The Court held that amending or repealing section 377 should be a matter left to Parliament, not the judiciary.</p>

    <p>On 6 February 2016, a three-member bench of the Court reviewed curative petitions submitted by the Naz Foundation and others, and decided that they would be reviewed by a five-member constitutional bench</p>

    <p>The Daily News and Analysis article added that Baba Ramdev, India's well-known yoga guru, after praying that journalists not "turn homosexual", stated he could "cure" homosexuality through yoga and called it "a bad addiction". The Vishwa Hindu Parishad's vice-president Om Prakash Singhal said, "This is a right decision, we welcome it. </p>

  <div class="column">
      <br>
    <p>Homosexuality is against Indian culture, against nature and against science. We are regressing, going back to when we were almost like animals. The SC had protected our culture." The article states that Singhal further went to dismiss HIV/AIDS concerns within the LGBT community as, "It is understood that when you try to suppress one anomaly, there will be a break-out of a few more."</p>
